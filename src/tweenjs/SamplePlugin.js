	 * Generally a plugin will also expose an <code>install</code> method as well, though this is not strictly necessary.

	 * @param {any} value The current tweened value of the property, as calculated by TweenJS.
	 * @param {Object} startValues A hash of all of the property values at the start of the current
	 * step. You could access the start value of the current property using
	 * startValues[prop].
	 * @param {Object} endValues A hash of all of the property values at the end of the current
	 * step.
	 * @param {Number} ratio A value indicating the eased progress through the current step. This
	 * number is generally between 0 and 1, though some eases will generate values outside
	 * this range.
	 * @param {Boolean} wait Indicates whether the current step is a "wait" step.
	 * @param {Boolean} end Indicates that the tween has reached the end.
	 * @return {any} Return the value that should be assigned to the target property. For example
	 * returning <code>Math.round(value)</code> would assign the default calculated value
	 * as an integer. Returning Tween.IGNORE will prevent Tween from assigning a value to
